  ## Description
  This command line application allows a user to catalogue members of a team consisting of a manager, engineers, and interns. After running the index.js file with node, the program prompts the user for information for each team member and once the team is finalized, it renders an html file that can be deployed to display each team member and their corresponding identifying information. This node app makes use of the inquirer package to interact with user input.
